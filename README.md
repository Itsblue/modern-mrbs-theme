# Modern MRBS Theme
A modern theme for [MRBS](https://mrbs.sourceforge.io/) based on Bootstrap 5.0.

# Usage
To use this theme, place it into the Themes folder of your mrbs. (eg. `/var/www/mrbs/Themes`) and add `$theme = "modern";` to your `config.inc.php`.

# PLEASE NOTE
This theme is a quick and dirty workaround. As MRBS does not have a real theme engine, it simply injects JavaScript which then modifies the page after it is loaded.
